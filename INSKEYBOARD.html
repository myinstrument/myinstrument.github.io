Electric pianos that utilized short strings, metal reeds, tines, or tone bars were used instead of long strings, were introduced in the 1940s. The vibrations were turned into electrical signals by pickups, and then sent to an amplifier. 
Electric grand pianos, which used short, real piano strings, were introduced by Yamaha in the late 1970s. 
In 1983, Yamaha introduced the first digital keyboard.

The days of playing the piano are long gone, now a days; keyboards are the way to go. They provide the same benefits and pure sound of a full sized piano or Grand piano along with extra sounds and instruments that can make anyone who is willing to learn into one person keyboard band. 
<br>Keyboard instruments therefore describe the range of sounds that electronic keyboards are now able to produce through various settings.

In its broadest sense, the term keyboard instrument may be applied to any instrument equipped with a keyboard and thus may be used to refer to accordions, percussion instruments such as the celesta and the carillon, and many electronic instruments—for example, the Moog synthesizer (see photograph) and the Ondes Martenot. 
In a narrower sense, such as is employed in this discussion, the term is restricted to instruments in which sound is produced from strings, whether by plucking, striking, or rubbing, or from pipes or reeds.
