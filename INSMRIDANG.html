<b><p><font style="font-family:Palatino Linotype; size:20; color:crimson">Mridangam, also spelled mrdangam, mridanga, or mrdanga, two-headed drum played in Karnatak music of southern India.
<br> It is made of wood in an angular barrel shape, having an outline like an elongated hexagon. 
Thong hoops around each end of the drum, leather thong lacing, and small wooden dowels slipped under the lacings control the skin tension.

<p><font style="font-family:Palatino Linotype; size:40; color:crimson">
A removable patch of tuning paste is affixed to each end, giving the drum a definite pitch. 
The left head is usually tuned an octave lower than the right. The drum is held across the lap and played on both ends with the hands and fingers. 
A similar instrument, the pakhavaj, is played in the Hindustani tradition of northern India, as well as in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
