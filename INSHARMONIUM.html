The Harmonium is an instrument that is indispensable in India and that is used in the religious field, in classical music, in folklore and for playing within the family. It owes its popularity mainly to its easy handling. The Harmonium can be compared in its functioning to the accordeon. 
<br>Air is pumped into an enclosed space by means of bellows. With a keyboard it is possible to open specially defined holes, through which the pumped air is then pressed. The reeds attached to the openings (double, triple or quadruple reeds) are set vibrating and so produce the desired note.

The harmonium used by Indians is generally hand-held & is placed on the floor while playing it. With one hand the musician plays the melody, he uses the other hand for the bellows.

The harmonium was a popular church and household instrument until the electronic organ drove it from the market after the 1930s. 
<br>Compositions for the instrument include numerous works by the French composers Cesar Franck and Louis Vierne and a quartet for two violins, cello, and harmonium by the Bohemian composer Antonin Dvorak.
