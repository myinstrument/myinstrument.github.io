The trumpet or cornet is the smallest and highest member of the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece. The difference between a trumpet and cornet is very minor. They both play the same notes and they sound virtually the same. In appearance, the trumpet looks a bit longer and more slender than a cornet. 
<br>The real difference has to do with the way the tubing of the instrument flares.

The trumpet is played with the right hand on top of the instrument with the first three fingers resting on the valves. 
The left hand holds the instrument with the fingers wrapped around the middle of the valves.

However, the trumpet is a very versatile and widely used instrument. Trumpets are always needed in bands, symphony orchestras, jazz groups and small instrumental groups.
 <br>It is very common for the trumpet to perform a large number of solos and melodic lines in all of these groups. The trumpet also works well as a solo instrument.
