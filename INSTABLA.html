<b><p><font style="font-family:Palatino Linotype; size:20; color:crimson">Tabla,pair of small drums fundamental (since the 18th century) to Hindustani music of northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. 
<br>The higher-pitched of the two drums, which is played with the right hand, is also referred to individually as the tabla or as the daya (dahina or dayan, meaning right). It is a single-headed drum usually of wood and having the profile of two truncated cones bulging at the centre, the lower portion shorter. It is about 25 cm (10 inches) in height and 15 cm (6 inches) across.
<br> Skin tension is maintained by thong lacings and wooden dowels that are tapped with a hammer in retuning. It is usually tuned to the tonic, or ground note, of the raga (melodic framework).

The baya (bahina or bayan, meaning left), played with the left hand, is a deep kettledrum measuring about 25 cm (10 inches) in height, and the drum face is about 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter. 
<br>It is usually made of copper but may also be made of clay or wood, with a hoop and thong lacings to maintain skin tension. Pressure from the heel of the players hand changes the tone colour and pitch. The tuning of the baya varies, but it may be a fifth or an octave below the daya. 
A disk of black tuning paste placed on the skin of each drum affects pitch and also generates overtones characteristic of the drums sound. 
<br>The musician plays the tabla while seated, with the baya to the left of the daya. Sound is produced on the drums through a variety of different finger and hand strokes. Each drum stroke can be expressed by a corresponding syllable, used for both teaching and performance purposes. 
<br>The intricate music of the drums reflects the rhythmic framework (tala) of the piece.
